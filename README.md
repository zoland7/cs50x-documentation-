# cs50x-documentation-

## About
This repository serves as the primary source for documenting my journey through the CS50x course. I will include summaries in my own words of each lecture and walk through my thought process for each problem set. I will not be including problem set submission files to uphold the academic honesty and integrity of the CS50x class.

## Structure 
'lectures/' - Will include the summaries of each lecture 
'problem-sets/' - A breakdown of each problem set in order 

## Goals
My goal for this class is to gain a better understanding of the field of computer science, learn what different languages do, and apply my knowledge to real-life applications.
